# whoop-re
Reverse engineering WHOOP's production API.

- Production URL: `https://api.prod.whoop.com`
- Development URL: `https://api.dev.whoop.com`
- Authorization URL: `https://api-7.whoop.com`

Needs bearer token for all requests, bearer tokens expire after 24 hours. Use Charles or another SSL sniffing tool to find this.

# Authorization routes
(note: these all use the authorization URL)
| Route      | Body | (Guessed) Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| /api/oauth | {"grant_type": "password", "username": "<your name>", "password": "<your password>"} | Returns access token, refresh token, expirty and user body |
| /users/{id} | n/a | Looks like another way to return member information - same data as `/membership` |

# Notes
- For `rollups_service`, the rollup returns a `sport_id` - ex, `60` is Rock Climbing. I haven't found an entire list of these yet, so it will be guess work until then.
